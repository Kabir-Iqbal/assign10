// 10. Adding Comments: 
// Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t 
// have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name 
// and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the 
// program does.

// Defined programes
let program1 : number = 5
let program2 : number =  10
// Addition program 
let addition : number = program1+program2
// print result 
console.log(addition);
